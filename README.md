# Overview
In this project, I am trying to develop a game using React Native and Expo. The game will have three different components: a bird (square), the floor, and obstacles. Abstacles will move forward and respawn every time they disappear. If the bird collides with the floor or the obstacles, the game will stop. If the bird successfully passes an obstacle, a point will be added to the score.

The purpose of creating this game is to get more familiar with React Native. To put into practice the knowledge that I gained from reading the documentation and what I know about JavaScript.

# Development Environment

The game was built in React Navite. I used VSCode to write all my code.

React Native is designed to build native applications for Android and iOS. The framework allows developers to create apps for various platforms by using the same codebase. It is based on React, a JavaScript library used for creating web user interfaces (UIs).

# Future Work

* I will implement adaptive music
* I will change the form of the bird, obstacles, and floor for images, so, it looks more as a game
